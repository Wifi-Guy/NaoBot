# Dependencies

To run this code, you are required to have:

threading, upgradedBot, PIL and Tkinter as well as all the dependicies listed in upgradedBot

This program extends upgradedBot to allow for use with multiple bots and remote control.

It uses a class containing all of the imported commands from upgradedBot, which are:

video - allows video control, follow - allows following the ball, tts - text to speech, demo - the demo of the connected space, stand - makes the bot stand up, sit - makes the bot sit down, walk - moves the bot forward backward left and right

More advanced information about these is available in upgradedBot

Video control uses a single Tkinter frame and gets the images to show both the bots working at the same time

To put code for the bots to do simultaneously, but them in ```bluetodo()``` and ```redtodo()```
